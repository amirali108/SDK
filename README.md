**Introduction**

**What is Secure Digital Communication (SDK)?**

Secure Digital Communication (SDK) offers a safe, simple, and secure way to send sensitive and classified information between various actors in the public sector. The goal is to increase security and efficiency for digital collaboration and information exchange, thereby providing better conditions for taking care of individuals who need support. Every day, vast amounts of information are exchanged between actors in the public sector. Often, this involves sensitive or classified information such as care plans, treatment plans, work ability assessments, and extracts from the criminal record. In the absence of safer alternatives, fax, mail, or couriers are used today, especially in healthcare, schools, and social services.

SDK is a digital infrastructure that enables public actors to exchange sensitive and classified information digitally in a safe, secure, and efficient manner. Private contractors with publicly funded assignments can also connect to SDK.
