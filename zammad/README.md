This README outlines the steps to deploy the Zammad Helpdesk System for managing customer support tickets. Zammad is an open-source 

support ticket system that provides a robust framework for handling customer inquiries and issues. This guide uses Docker and Ansible 

for deployment, ensuring a streamlined setup process.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker and Ansible installed on your system. You will need:

-Docker Engine

-Docker Compose

-Ansible

Installation Steps

Clone the Project Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine or server:

git clone https://example.com/your-repo.git

cd your-repo/zammad

Setup Environment Variables

Copy the sample environment variable file and modify it according to your needs:

cp .env.example .env

nano .env

Deploy with Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose to deploy Zammad and its dependencies (Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL):

docker-compose up -d

Inventory File and Ansible Playbook

Create an Inventory File

Create an inventory file named inventory.ini in your project directory. This file should include the IP addresses of the servers where you want to deploy Zammad:

nano inventory.ini

Inside the nano editor, you would add the configuration details for your servers.

Create an Ansible Playbook Create an Ansible playbook named install zammad.yml. This playbook will be used to configure Zammad post-deployment:

nano install_zammad.yml

Run Ansible Playbooks

Execute the Ansible playbook to configure Zammad post-deployment:

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_zammad.yml
